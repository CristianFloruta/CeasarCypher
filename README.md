# CaesarCypher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. 
It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 
For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. 
The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

This Caesar Cypher is using a list of latin alphabet. The letter are shifted to the right based on user inputs.
There are two simplem encrypting and decrypting functions that are alowing encrypted communication between multiple user.

Have fun!!
